Binary classification problem to predict whether credit card applications will be accepted or rejected


This file concerns credit card applications.  All attribute names
    and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect
    confidentiality of the data.
  
    This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of
    attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of
    values, and nominal with larger numbers of values.  There
    are also a few missing values.

A Random Forest binary classifier ended up being the best generalizer of this particular data.  Accuracy of approximately 90% was achieved on both training and test sets.  Information on this dataset can be found here:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/credit-screening/
